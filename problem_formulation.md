# Sprint 1: Problem Formulation

### **Main Challenge**

How can Fiskerikajen use data to improve pricing decisions and identify the most profitable seafood products throughout the year?

### Context

Fiskerikajen handles a wide range of fish and shellfish products that vary in price, weight, and seasonal availability. Making data-driven decisions is essential for maximizing profitability and maintaining a competitive edge. Since profit margins can vary based on the season, freight costs, and product characteristics, understanding these patterns can help Fiskerikajen optimize pricing and purchasing strategies across the year.

### Purpose

The purpose of this project is to identify the most profitable seafood products per season and to develop a predictive model that estimates both the price and profit of seafood based on key features such as weight, year, season, and freight charge. 

### Research questions

1. **WWhich seafood products are the most profitable across different seasons and years?**

2. **Can the price and profit of seafood be predicted based on features like weight, season, year, and freight charge?**
   
3. **How does weight influence the price of seafood across different years and product types??**

4. **To what extent do freight charges affect pricing and overall profitability?**
  
### Hypotheses

1. Profitability varies across seasons and years.
2. A regression model using key features (weight, year, season, freight charge) can accurately predict both price and profit.
3. The relationship between weight and price is positive but may differ between product types and over time.
4. Freight charges may have an influence on pricing 

## Which challenge you would like to address?

The main challenge is to help Fiskerikajen identify the most profitable products over time and predict future prices and profits using key product features. This involves using Business Intelligence (BI) to visualize historical data and patterns, and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to forecast prices and uncover pricing inefficiencies.

### The project includes building:
1. A machine learning model that predicts price and profit
2. A dashboard that enables interactive exploration of seafood trends across season, year, and type



### Why is this challenge important or interesting research goal?

In a market where seafood prices and profits are influenced by seasonal availability, weight, and transportation costs, it is difficult to ensure stable profitability without data analysis. By combining BI and AI, Fiskerikajen can gain:
* Descriptive insights: What has happened?
* Predictive insights: What is likely to happen?

This enables smarter planning, forecasting, and pricing decisions that improve profitability.

### What is the expected solution your project would provide?

- A **BI dashboard** that visualizes:
    - Profitability by product, season, and year
    - How freight charge influences price
    - Price trends relative to weight over time

- An **AI regression model** that:
    - Predicts price and profit based on weight, freight charge, season, and year.

### What would be the positive impact of the solution, which category of users could benefit from it?

- Fiskerikajenâ€™s pricing managers can use the dashboard to:
    - Get insight over prevouise prices and profits
    - Forecast price and profit before buying
    - Identify which products yield the best profits across time

## Conclusion and Solution
This project demonstrates how Fiskerikajen can use data and machine learning to make more informed pricing decisions and identify the most profitable seafood products throughout the seasons and years.

By analyzing product data and training regression models, I found that:

1. Seafood profitability changes across seasons and years, and it's easy to spot which products perform best in each period using data visualizations.
2. Price and profit can be predicted accurately using just a few product features like weight, season, year, and freight charge. 
3. The machine learning models performed well, with R² scores around 0.60 and low errors (MAE ≈ 10.4 kr, RMSE ≈ 12.76 kr), meaning they can be trusted to make general predictions.
4. Weight clearly affects price, although the relationship varies depending on product type and year..
5. Freight charges only have a weak impact on price, which suggests they play a bigger role in profit margins than in setting the price itself.
